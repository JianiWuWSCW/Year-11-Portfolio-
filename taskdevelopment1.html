  <h4>Testing</h4>
  
  <p>
  The character design is a bit sloppy, with some areas needing to be painted more carefully or it might affect subsequent model-making. 
  The hands, face and other parts need improvement.

   <h4>Feedback</h4>

   <h5>What do you like about the Trunaround?</h5>

   <p>I like the proportions and your character's tie and cape</p>
   <p>I like the outfit because it gives a great aesthetic and added personality to the chracter.</p>


   <h5>What don't you like about the turnaround?</h5>

   <p>I think the weather is unnecessary. </p>
   <p>The arm is a bit off compared to the other but I doubt it is an issue when modelling. In general It's a nice simple design that is unique. </p>
