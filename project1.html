  <h2>low poly character</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>My games are based in reality and take climate and weather issues as a backdrop (e.g. global warming, increase in severe weather events, etc.). 
    In this world, climate change is out of balance, leading to frequent natural disasters. 
    The living environment of biological and human beings is seriously threatened. As a "Weathering boy", 
    he will face the challenge of saving a world shrouded in climate chaos, and players will fight side by side with him to face the challenges from "weather and climate".
<hr>

My game character is a weather boy with "superpowers". He can control the weather, but he cannot control the climate.
He is 1.75 meters tall and weighs 70 kilograms. He is fourteen years old with black eyes and black hair. 
He wears a white T-shirt with a clear doll in the upper left corner of his clothes. He often wears a black cloak. 
There is a miniature sun, a miniature cloud, and a small lightning bolt swirling around the top of his head, visible only to himself and special people.
As for why he has this super power, how he uses this super power, and his background, I'm going to think about that later.

  <h3>End user </h3>
  <p> The end users of my characters are players interested in adventure, exploration, and superpower stories.
     When my character is complete, my end users will probably be more towards younger players, like teenagers. 
     Younger players may especially enjoy going on an adventure with a character close to their own age and experiencing novelty and excitement through his stories and experiences.
     <hr>
     Additionally, My End User also targets players who enjoy weather, climate, and environmental issues. 
     Because the background of the game is based on reality and involves important topics such as climate change, for players who like weather, climate and environmental issues, 
     they can explore and learn about weather and climate issues in this world with "Weathering boy".

      How our low poly character needs to look depends on the person who chooses to use it,
