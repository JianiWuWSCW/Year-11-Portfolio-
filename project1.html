  <h2>low poly character</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>My games are based in reality and take climate and weather issues as a backdrop (e.g. global warming, increase in severe weather events, etc.). 
    In this world, climate change is out of balance, leading to frequent natural disasters. 
    The living environment of biological and human beings is seriously threatened. As a "Weather Child", 
    he will face the challenge of saving a world shrouded in climate chaos, and players will fight side by side with him to face the challenges from "weather and climate".
<hr>

My game character is a weather boy with "superpowers". He can control the weather, but he cannot control the climate.
He is 1.75 meters tall and weighs 65 kilograms. He is fourteen years old with black eyes and black hair. 
He wears a white T-shirt with a clear doll in the upper left corner of his clothes. He often wears a black cloak. 
There is a miniature sun, a miniature cloud, and a small lightning bolt swirling around the top of his head, visible only to himself and special people.
As for why he has this super power, how he uses this super power, and his background, I'm going to think about that later.

    <td>Aesthetics is about making the outcome look and feel good.
      How our low poly character needs to look depends on the person who chooses to use it,
      and I think most people will want the good looking character.
      I need a good looking character.
