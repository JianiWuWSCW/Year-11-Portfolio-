      <tr>
        <td>The problem for here is the code "Pass".
          In Python,In Python, the pass statement is a placeholder used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any code to be executed. 
          It essentially does nothing and is often used as a temporary placeholder for code that you plan to write later or as a way to create minimal classes or functions during initial development.
          I think that's why the game can not get into next step.

          So I swiched their places,then deleted the "pass" code.
          Also I added the "print("The number should bigger than 0,smaller than 1000")" after "if answer>1000 and answer smaller than 1.
        </td>

          <p>"I added the answer== after answer=="a" or and answer==a or"</p>
          <p>For here ,I relized that the "c".lower() is just a string "c" and doesn't compare it with answer.
            a and c are not defined variables, causing a NameError if this code is run.
          or maybe the computer can not recognize it when we enter option "c" for this question. </p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<h4>Any final feedback, especially about the new changes?</h4>
<p>I don't think there are any technical errors in my code, But next time I can try to make my code a little more complex and make the game a little more accurate and have more conditions.</p>
<p>Nonononono.I think my code is perfect!!!!!!!thank you very much!!!!! </p>
