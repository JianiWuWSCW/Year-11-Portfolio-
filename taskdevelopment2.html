  <p>For how to make a torso, I added a cube in blender, deleted half of it, 
    and then mirrored it to create the base of the torso. </p>

  <p>The above picture is already the torso after my development，
    because when I was improving my torso,there was no screenshot taken at the time
    I didn't make the screenshot before my torso improving and after.Therefore, 
    it is not possible to show the comparison diagram of torso before and after improvement.）
Now that I've saved my entire character and can't go back to my torso part, 
I've tried many different ways of breaking it down without success, so sorry about this.
